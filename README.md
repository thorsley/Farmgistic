# Farmgistic

Farmgistic holistically servers local farmers markets by giving them simple tools to keep customers and vendors informed. The core of the application is the mapping function, Market Managers are able to use an intuitive drag and drop interface to select which vendor booths will be at their market, and place them on a simple map. Users can view this map to be better prepared for what to expect at the market.

## App Example

once Logged in as a basic user you will be able to immediately see any booths you have favorited, as well as viewing the maps for the different markets submitted.
